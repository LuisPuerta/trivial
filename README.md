This is a Trivial (board) game which gameplay is completely made with Javascript/jQuery. For the questions, you can choose the blocks (themes), categories, dificulties and more

Also, you have 2 game modes: Versus (player vs player) and a Solo mode where you can just play alone and try to complete the match in the shortest possible time.

There are 5 "special cells" where you need to land and correctly answer the question, this will give you a "cheese/star" for that specific category (each category has also its proper color).

As a board game, each player plays by rolling a dice a moving around the board with the numbers they get by the dice, there's also some "dice cells" that let the player roll the dice again in the same turn.
